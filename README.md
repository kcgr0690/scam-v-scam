... Scammer vs Scammer...
By Marwa (yes... that Marwa.. heh) and Kasey (Queso)

SORRY FOR NOT DOING THE README... queso is _employed_ and marwa has 5 billion assignments due... but HERE WE GO!!!

ALRIGHT so although "Scammer vs Scammer" isn't in it's final version yet, the main premise of this game is that your friend sends you a link that they heard from online is a "reliable website for physics help" (I mean at this point, who wouldn't click that). However, when you click on it, a bunch of _interesting_ pop-ups appear on your screen (you can tell who designed them) and you have to try to close these tabs to access the content. At one point, the pop-ups will move like a rhythm game (that part has been coded, but not visually implemented yet), and then after you clear the rhythm game, you may think that you're done clicking the pop-ups, but this humungous pop-up appears and it says that the smaller pop-ups somehow some way helped the website creator steal your information you, and that you need to send $5000 through email or phone number, which is a form of ransomware (that page hasn't visually been applied yet). Since paying for ransomware doesn't guarantee your data back and you're also given some aspects of their personal information (email and phone number as mentioned above), why not find a way to access them (and sell this info on Temu!!! This isn't coded yet... heh...) By choosing what information to access, the player can be assured that they will be able to sell the scammer's information (if they win obviously). 

Uhhhhh this game was very funny and stressful to create during Parathenon. Although the design was lacking, we (Marwa) added a lot of satire, "brainrotted" elements, and presenting them was very fun as it generated lots of laughs. We also pushed our skills in learning Javascript. However, while brainstorming, Queso and I were a bit too ambitious on what to do, so we ended up not really finishing the basics of it despite pulling an all-nighter. I am not necessarily great at time management in general, and since this was a two-person team, this effect may have gone to Queso as well. This is also our first Hackathon, so we're not that experienced with time in terms of that, and that's okay!!! To be honest, if I were to do something like this again, I would focus on one aspect of my game and code it in a way that it makes my game look nice and clean. Then, I would add extra details if I have time (directly quoting from Meghana as I should've listened to her advice). Also, this reminds me that I should learn more languages and code more whenever I'm free, so finishing this game (hopefully with Queso) would be a good stretch :)

**Title Screen**
<img width="1440" height="704" alt="very interesting title screen. computer screen on right displays game title, Scam v. Scam. There is a Marwa on the bottom left nest to the computer looking at you eagerly to play her game. Queso is on the top left sitting on the lid of the computer screen, but you can't see her because the window browser doesn't like her (joke)." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d169b9f7-8929-4d02-89f7-bbe73e317d15" />
